      <h4>Assumptions</h4>
      <li>Online dataing is not common</li>
      <li>People only care about appearance</li>
      <li>Online dataing can't be serious</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <h4>Open end question from assumptions</h4>
      <li>What is the research paper show, and source of the dataset</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <h3>Research for Data Brief</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Who? - Who are we talking about? Who is included and not included?

        Context - But you still need to go to those places, wheter it's
        plysically to go there or to make the time to understand the thing
        you're representing better than you already do. - JER THORP

      <li>To Whom? - Who are we talking to?</li>
      <li>
