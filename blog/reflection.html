            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            1. The power of YET : Everytime I get stuck in my programming
            learning, I start to tell myself. I am not understand
            <strong>YET!</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            2. Neuroplasticity : I start believe my learning abilities by slowly
            feeding my brain with more patient, and repeated explaning the code
            line by line when I get a solutions how thing is working.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Creating daily mental break : That I start to see cores work as
            mental break that enable me to think. To make time for my brains. I
            start to connect things with "how things work in programming
            sequence".
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: rgb(190, 118, 190)">
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The values, empathy, and self awareness are the key skills of global
            citizens and important prerequisites for learning to live together.
            <br />
            By understanding the need with empathy, being aware of and being
            sensitive to the feelings of others as human. From there, we
            identify problems, to collaborate and be creative and provide
            innovative ideas. As a coder, we then translate human requirements
            into programming languages and direct computers to develop digital
            solutions.

          <h3 style="color: rgb(190, 118, 190)">
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            As Idealistism, I wish to know how to pairing these concepts with
            JavaScript projects which i don't quite know how yet. I often trying
            to connect my new knowledges with what I am able to do practically.
            To make a good conclusion, I always dive deep to read one article
            after another. Hoping to read enough from different aspect. I get
            lost in the internet rabbit hole that I have to force myself to
            "Wake up" when time is ticking, and due date is way behind.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: rgb(190, 118, 190)">
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much
            time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think learning programming is not easy as sometimes our brain keep
            trick us and said I can't see it, I am not able to do it. It always
            cause lots of anxiety and frustrating. With the core learning, not
            only to make class more interesting and It is a good get away! It
            take me out to realize what is happening around me, and get courage
            when the learning emotional is building up.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: rgb(190, 118, 190)">
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead? Justify your answer.

            It is valuable soft-skill and knowledge to have. Is also provide
            good content to make a nice website! Hopefully so far, reader can
            understand what I wrote. I wish I am a better writer!
