              <p>
                I am looking forward to build a website that is professional, 
                attractive website that able to interact with users. 
                
                Focusing on JavaScript, I will have in-dept understanding a programming language.
                To create dynamic behavior of a website, allowed me to provide solutions as close as I planned.
                With great empathy, to create websites where functionality meet aesthetic.
                Adopt growth-mind set and Neuroplasticity, I will eventually become a full stack developer.

                 <!-- Have you discovered any new ones during this course?  -->
               
                My strengths: Curious, creative and Open-minded.  <br>
                I will trying to solve all the problems I come across.
                With design thinking and empathetic, I can see some users problem, create human-centered website.
                I am open to take advice anytime, good at listening without being judgemental.
                
                My limitations: 
                Eventhough I am very patience in learning, but I am a slow learning, 
                not good at Math/ logic thinking. <br>
                 English is not my frist language, I can't write web content.

                <!-- How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp? -->
                The best way to work with me will be set up idea deadlines, 
                and check-point with clear expectations to keep me on track.

                I would like to know how to define where the focus/ problem is. It will enable me to learn and solve problem efficiency.
                Staying calm while I come accross to new problem, and keep my energy focus on solving problem instead of being upset.
                With the technical skill I learn in bootcamp, I like to apply on to art project I have in mind.
